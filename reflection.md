# Reflection

During the development process, I focused on maintaining a balance between functionality and adherence to the given requirements. Structuring the HTML and adding comments to both the HTML and CSS files required careful thought to ensure clarity and conciseness without altering the original structure of the code.

### Challenges Faced
One of the primary challenges was interpreting the provided screenshot and replicating its design as accurately as possible while staying within the constraints of the existing HTML structure. Additionally, I had to ensure that the CSS properties used would work well across various browsers and screen sizes.

Another challenge was maintaining brevity while providing meaningful comments in the code. It was important to explain key styling decisions without overwhelming the files with unnecessary detail.

### Solutions
To overcome these challenges, I relied on a methodical approach:
1. **Systematic Styling**: I broke the design into sections and styled each part separately to match the provided screenshot, ensuring consistency and precision.
2. **Effective Comments**: I focused on adding only essential comments that explained the purpose of key sections and styling choices.
3. **Cross-Referencing**: By frequently comparing the output with the screenshot, I ensured the layout and styles were aligned with the desired design.

This exercise was a valuable experience in applying CSS systematically while working within constraints, and it reinforced the importance of clear, concise code documentation.
